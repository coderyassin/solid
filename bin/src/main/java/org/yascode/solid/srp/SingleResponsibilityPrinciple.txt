The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of
object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change,
meaning it should have only one responsibility.

Why is SRP Important?
Maintainability:

A class with a single responsibility is easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

Reusability:

Classes with a single responsibility are more likely to be reused in other parts of
the program.

Testability:

Itâ€™s easier to test a class that does only one thing.

Scalability:

If a class has a single responsibility, future changes will have less impact on the rest
of the code.
