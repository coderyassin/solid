The fifth principle of SOLID is the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). It states that:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

n simpler terms, this principle encourages you to depend on abstractions
(e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.
This makes your code more flexible, maintainable, and testable.

/******************************************************************************************/

Why is the Dependency Inversion Principle Important?
Decouples Code:

High-level modules (e.g., business logic) are not tightly coupled to low-level modules
(e.g., database access or external services). This makes the system easier to modify and
extend.

Improves Testability:

By depending on abstractions, you can easily replace real implementations with mock objects
for testing.

Promotes Reusability:

Abstractions can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects.

Enhances Flexibility:

You can change the behavior of the system by swapping out implementations without modifying
the high-level logic.

Key Concepts of DIP
High-Level Modules:

These are modules that contain the core business logic or application logic.
They are typically more abstract and less concerned with implementation details.

Low-Level Modules:

These are modules that handle specific tasks, such as database access, file I/O,
or external API calls. They are more concrete and focused on implementation details.

Abstractions:

These are interfaces or abstract classes that define a contract for behavior.
They act as a bridge between high-level and low-level modules.

Dependency Injection:

A technique used to implement DIP, where dependencies (e.g., low-level modules) are
"injected" into high-level modules rather than being created directly.
